                <p class="pb-2">Hi! I'm Jamie, a web developer from south Alabama with 7 years of professional experience in the digital space. I've worn many hats – developer, designer, creative director, and entrepreneur –  and honed skills in programming, design, and project management along the way.</p>

                <p class="pb-2">I received my B.S. in Anthropology in 2016. I still just love anthropology - studying society, ancient cultures, and weaving together all of the different threads of evolution that led us to the humans we are today. I discovered anthropology after I read a book by Zora Neale Hurston called “Tell My Horse”, and enjoyed it so much and after reading more about her, decided to make it my major. These days, that intellectual curiosity fuels both my professional endeavors and personal pastimes.</p>

                <p class="pb-2">So how did an anthropology major end up as a web developer? I’ve been “on the internet” since I was like 11 - there was this really cool site called “Matmice” that I used to build websites on, back when you had to use iframes to load in different sections of your web page. I mostly used to build really embarrassing fan pages for my favorite pop bands, or cutesy websites for those “edolls” that used to be popular. Then of course, there was Myspace - if you know you know. </p>

                <p class="pb-2">After leaving high school, I casually studied programming here and there, and got my first job as a developer working on Wordpress websites in 2017. There I learned a lot about web and graphic design, working with a team, and ultimately rose to be the creative director of that digital marketing agency.</p>

                <p class="pb-2">In 2020 I started my own digital marketing agency, and while I learned a lot during that experience, I also came to realize that I don’t enjoy the marketing and strategy side as much as I do building things and solving problems. After a couple more tech jobs and freelance work, that brings us to today, to Pixel Brew - where I bring all of my previous experience, determination and out-of-the-box thinking to every task I do.</p>

                <p class="pb-2">On a personal note, I'd describe myself as something of an introvert and homebody at heart. When I'm not hanging out with my 11 year old son, Liam, or cozied up reading books on culture, astrology, or just the latest good fiction release, I love getting out and exploring new restaurants and frequent thrift and antique shops, iced coffee or honeydew boba (my favorite) in hand. I also love binging my favorite TV shows or playing Stardew Valley. Traveling is a passion of mine as well, and I have lots of upcoming plans to get out and see the world. My favorite destinations I’ve visited so far are Jamaica, Los Angeles, and New Orleans. My next dream destinations are New York City and Paris.</p>

                <p class="pb-2">So, that’s pretty much it about me. Pretty windy for someone who doesn’t like talking about herself. :) If you’d like to chat, you can email me at jamie@pixelbrew.co or hit the little chat icon in the bottom right corner of this website. I’d love to meet you!</p>
